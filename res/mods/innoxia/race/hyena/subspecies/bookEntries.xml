		Hyena-morphs are almost exclusively found in the savannah and desert in the south of Lilith's Realm, although the odd individual may sometimes be seen wandering the streets of Dominion. Rounded ears, predatory eyes, and their distinctive spotted or striped fur is usually enough to identify a person as a hyena-morph.

		While the individual personalities of hyena-morphs vary greatly from one individual to another, they have a reputation for being both aggressive and opportunistic. Often choosing to group up into gangs, hyena-morphs can pose a significant threat to travellers who choose to venture off the main road that links Dominion to the desert city of Thinis.

	<p>
		Hyena-morphs are split into two distinct subspecies; the spotted hyena-morph and the striped hyena-morph. The most striking feature of spotted hyena-morphs is that their females typically have an extraordinarily large clitoris. They often choose to use this as a pseudo-penis in sexual intercourse, as well as to intimidate and belittle males whose penises are smaller than their clits.
	</p>
	<p>
		Striped hyena-girls, on the other hand, have no such alarming characteristic. The most striking feature of this other subspecies is the the fact that the vast majority of both males and females style their fur-like hair into mohawks, which, combined with their natural striped patterning, makes them appear quite intimidating.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like most other races, hyena-morphs get affected by arcane storms. However, due to the fact that most of them live far away from Dominion's epicentre of such storms, they typically only experience mild effects.

	<p>
		A hyena-morph's offspring will be a mixture of hyena-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
